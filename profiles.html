              My name is Maii and I've been playing ACNH since launch! I've been an avid Animal Crossing fan and player since the Gamecube version and have logged probably close to 6000 hours across all games! I love being able to design my villagers' houses as well my own and now, even personalise an entire island! Though the terraforming mechanic in the game isn't the best, it's has given me great freedom to unleash my creativity without any consequences and I really enjoy that aspect about this series.

              Hi, I'm Charlotte! I've played every AC game since Wild World and have spent 500+ hours on New Horizons. I love how you can personalize your island and its creative freedom that the older games didn't offer. My only critique is the repetitive villager dialogue. I miss the quirky conversations and dynamic personalities from past games, which I hope they'll bring back for the next installment! All in all, Animal Crossing is my favourite childhood series, one that I hold close to my heart and I'm excited to see what comes next!

              My name is Yen and I have been a fan of Animal Crossing since Wild World. I would play on my pink DS Lite and I remember I'd always write heartfelt letters to my favourite villagers. Happy Home Paradise is definitely my favourite to play as I love decorating vacation homes for the characters. I always try to do the unique themes because I get to be more creative and explore designs I normally wouldn't do. I've yet to complete designing my own island which will be nature themed.
